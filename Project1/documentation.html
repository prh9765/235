            <h1>Process</h1>
            <p>The way I went about doing the project was fairly straightforward. First I created the outline
                for the page as a whole, and created a markdown file for it. Then I created the basis of the 
                html files, and added in the outlined text. After appropriately adding different tags to different
                areas, I added css to make the page look a lot nicer. Finally, I created the images to be used,
                as well as making the whole page responsive.
            </p>
            <h1>Specs</h1>
            <p>The game treatment was written with the outline in mind, and all related content was filled in.
                The file structure and code was all checked for validity. Proper semantic code is written.
                Css was used with the proper specifications. All deliverables were met on time.
            </p>
            <h1>Sources</h1>
            <p>All images were created by myself using Photoshop. Any help I needed with code was found on
                the class notes, the textbook, or using online resources, such as W3Schools.
