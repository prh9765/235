                and based on this they need to be put in the propper hole. When the level is right, Dave
                can move to the next level.
            </p>
            <p>Controls - Keyboard keys, either wasd or the arrow keys.</p>

            <p>Teaching the Player - First level will have explanation, and any time a new feature is added there
                will be an explanation on the screen.</p>

            <p>Player Learning - There may be different attributes to different cubes, making there be different
                things the player needs to consider when moving cubes around. Ex. Cubes that are bouncy, or slippery.
