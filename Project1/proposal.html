            <h1>I. High Concept</h1>
            <p>While moving around different blocks, Help Dave, the cube, regain his lost sandwich.</p>

            <h1>II. Genre</h1>
            <p>Puzzle</p>

            <h1>III. Platform</h1>
            <p>Desktop, browser based</p>

            <h1>IV. Story</h1>
            <p>Help Dave move through the level by moving around cubes. More of a lighthearted feel.
                Motive is to help Dave acquire his sandwich.</p>

            <h1>V. Esthetics</h1>
            <p>Graphics style - Cartoonish</p>
            <p>Sound - 8-bit. Background music, potentially a sound for completing a level, or moving a piece.</p>

            <h1>VI. Gameplay</h1>
            <p>Mechanics - Moving around cubes to fill holes in the ground. Cubes can be different sizes
                and based on this they need to be put in the propper hole. When the level is right, Dave
                can move to the next level.
            </p>
            <p>Controls - Keyboard keys, either wasd or the arrow keys.</p>

            <p>Teaching the Player - First level will have explanation, and any time a new feature is added there
                will be an explanation on the screen.</p>

            <p>Player Learning - There may be different attributes to different cubes, making there be different
                things the player needs to consider when moving cubes around. Ex. Cubes that are bouncy, or slippery.
            </p>
